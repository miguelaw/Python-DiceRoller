# Python-DiceRoller (Python)

## Description

This project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice. When the program runs, it will ask if the user wants to play. 

If the user doesn't want to play, the app will end. Otherwise the app will ask the user to select the number of dice to roll

To conclude, the program will print what that number is. 


## Concepts to keep in mind:

* Random function
* Variables
* Integers
* Input
* Print
* If/Else statements
